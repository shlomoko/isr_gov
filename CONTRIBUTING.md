# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO ISR_GOV

This file describes how to

- contribute changes to the project


## HOW TO COMMIT CONTRIBUTIONS

Contributions to the project are made using the "Fork & Pull" model. The
typical steps would be:

1. create an account on [github](https://github.com)
2. fork [isr_gov](https://github.com/isr_gov)
3. make a local clone: `git clone https://github.com/your_account/isr_gov.git`
4. make changes on the local copy
5. test and commit changes `git commit -a -m "my message"`
6. `push` to your GitHub account: `git push origin`
7. create a Pull Request (PR) from your GitHub fork
(go to your fork's webpage and click on "Pull Request."
You can then add a message to describe your proposal.)


## WHAT CODE LAYOUT SHOULD I FOLLOW?

Don't worry too much - maintainers can help reorganise contributions.
However it would be helpful to bear in mind:

- The standard core of `isr_gov`
    + must have negligible impact on performance
    + should be appropriately commented
